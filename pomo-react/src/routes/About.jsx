                <p> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that can be used for any task. For many people, time is an enemy. The anxiety triggered by “the ticking clock”, especially when it involves a deadline, leads to ineffective work and study habits which in turn lead to procrastination.</p>
                <p>The Pomodoro Technique aims to use time as a valuable ally in accomplishing what we want to do in the way we want to do it, and to enable us to continually improve the way we work or study.</p>

                <p>Other benefits:
                  <ul>
                  <li>Alleviate anxiety linked to beginning a task</li>
                    <li>Enhance focus and concentration by cutting down on interruptions</li>
                    <li>Increase awareness of your decisions</li>
                    <li>Boost motivation and keep it constant</li>
                    <li>Bolster the determination to achieve your goals</li>
                    <li>Refine the estimation process, both in qualitative and quantitative terms</li>
                    <li>Improve your work or study process</li>
                    <li>Strengthen your resolve to keep on applying yourself in the face of complex situations</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Tips to keep in mind:
                  <ul>
                    <li>If a task takes more than 5 Pomodoros, break it down</li>
                    <li>If it takes less than one Pomodoro, add it up, and combine it with another task</li>
                    <li>The next Pomodoro will go better</li>
                    <li>The Pomodoro Technique should <strong><u>not</u></strong> be used for activities you do in your free time. Enjoy your free time!</li>
